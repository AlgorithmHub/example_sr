Super-Resolution Imaging
========================
This program has been modified to run under Octave.

This program allows a user to perform registration of a set of low
resolution input images and reconstruct a high resolution image from them.
Multiple image registration and reconstruction methods have been
implemented. As input, the user can either select existing images, or
generate a set of simulated low resolution images from a high resolution
image.
