% CREATE_IMAGES - generate low resolution shifted and rotated images
%    [s, ground_truth] = create_images(im,delta,phi,scale,nr,snr)
%    create NR low resolution images from a high resolution image IM,
%    with shifts DELTA (multiples of 1/8) and rotation angles PHI (degrees)
%    the low resolution images have a factor SCALE less pixels
%    in both dimensions than the input image IM
%    if SNR is specified, noise is added to the different images to obtain
%    the given SNR value
