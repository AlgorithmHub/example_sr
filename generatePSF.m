function PSF = generatePSF(v, h, I)
% GENERATEPSF - generate a point spread function matrix
% This function generates a PSF (point spread function) matrix to use in a
% matrix multiplication (i.e. not a convolution) with the image I
% V is the vector containing the first non-zero values of the first column
% of the resulting Toeplitz matrix
% H is the vector containing the first non-zero values of the first line
% of the resulting Toeplitz matrix
% I is the image the PSF matrix is for (the resulting PSF matrix will thus
% have the same dimsensions as I)
